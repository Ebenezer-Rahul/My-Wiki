String Searching

== idea == 

The main idea is to preprocess the string to be searched 
and build a table which lets us skip more than one char at a time

Skip table as 

skip[c] = max(1, posFromLast);

do this form i = 0 to n over the string 

it is important to do this from front to back as we can skip 

// will write it down later it's simple
